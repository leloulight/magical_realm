magic_spells
------------

An API for magical spells. See magic_spells/API.txt for more info.

To test spells, you can give yourself a testing wand with
"/give player_name magic_spells:creative_stick". If you are playing on single-player,
the player name will be "singleplayer". Also, give yourself a
magic_spells:creative_spellbook. You can also find these items in the creative
menu.

To learn a spell, left-click with the spellbook, choose a spell, and hit "Learn".
To prepare a spell, right-click with the spellbook, and choose a spell through there.

To use the wand, first select a spell by right-clicking. Then you can cast the spell
by left-clicking.

To remove all your prepared spells, go to the spell-learning menu and hit
"Unprepare".
